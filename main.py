Our actions are movies, which take us from one actor to another (it is true that a movie could take us to multiple different actors, but thatâ€™s okay for this problem). Our initial state and goal state are defined by the two people we are trying to connect. By using breadth-first search, we can find the shortest path from one actor to another.")
